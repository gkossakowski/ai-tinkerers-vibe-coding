# zod Validation Schema Example

In this folder, you'll find an example of a plan and a documentation that was created after the plan was executed.

It represents how we implemented Zod Validation Schemas across the whole repo in one go. It introduced validations for all inputs and all API routes. Letting the agent implement if by following a detailed plan felt like a one-shot, everything worked as intended and saved us probably at least two days of development.
