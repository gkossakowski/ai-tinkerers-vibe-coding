Before you start coding, please create a directory and a document in ./docs/ux-patterns/ux-deleting-resources.md and save your detailed plan there, allowing me to start another conversation with you. All necessary context from our conversation must end up there. Also, please break the task into smaller phases and tasks and add checkboxes to track progress. Please reference all files that might be useful and informative to work on this feature.
