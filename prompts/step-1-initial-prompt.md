Me and my colleague had a discussion that our app is missing an important UX pattern: confirmations for deleting resources. I have accidentally deleted couple of Interviews myself.

I'd like you to come up with a plan to implement the following:

- Confirmation dialogs whenever user decides to delete something
- The dialog should follow the popular UX pattern of askig the user to type "delete <name-of-interview>"
- The dialog should validate input real time, client-side, with nice feedback if user mistypes
- There should a cancel button
- Escape key and clicking outside the dialog should close dialog
- Use existing components from the codebase
- Adhere to @validation.md .

Before you start working on the plan, do your research and clarify any ambiguities by asking me questions first. Prefix each question with a letter, prefix each suggested answer with a number so I can reference them easily.
