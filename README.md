AI Prompts from Warsaw AI Tinkerers "MAX vibe coding" talk by [Greg Kossakowski](https://x.com/gkossakowski) and [Patryk Kabaj](https://x.com/patrykkabaj) on 26th June 2025.

## Example PRD

If you're starting with just blank Cursor (or any other AI coding editor), but have an idea for a project, we recommend you start with preparing a PRD.

You can find an example of a prompt for PRD brainstorming and creation in the `examples/unpitched-prd-brainstorming.md` file. That file is very long due to a complete example of a real PRD that we include in the prompt. In `examples/unpitched-prd-brainstorming-template-with-long-example-stripped.md` you can find a shorter version of the prompt that doesn't include the example PRD; the rest of the prompt is relatively lightweight and straightforward.

We found the Grok 3 in thinking mode to be the best model for this prompt and task. You can access it for free at grok.com.

## Full Cursor chat

In the `examples/full-cursor-chat.md` file you can find the whole, multi-step conversation with Cursor that we presented at AI Tinkerers Warsaw meetup. You can dig into details and find more tricks that we use in our daily work and didn't have time to cover in the talk.
